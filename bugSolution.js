The correct approach involves using the `.then()` method to handle the promise returned by `AsyncStorage.setItem()`. This ensures that subsequent actions only execute after the data has been successfully stored.

```javascript
// Correct usage
AsyncStorage.setItem('myKey', 'myValue')
.then(() => {
  console.log('Item stored successfully!');
})
.catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error storing item:', error);
});
```

This corrected code snippet uses `.then()` to execute the `console.log` statement only after `AsyncStorage.setItem` completes successfully. The `.catch()` block handles any potential errors during the storage process.
